## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
The script does not require URLs to end in .xml, as long as the content is valid RSS.

Some feeds may not include all fields (e.g., <creator> or <description>); in those cases, "N/A" will be displayed.

Invalid URLs or connection issues will be reported after processing all feeds.
